# family-calendar
A family calendar using the google api calendar

## Installation
First you need to download the libraries to handle the API requests and display the calendar in a user-friendly format (for the moment we are gonna be using tkinter for the GUI, but in the future we will move to a web family calendar):

```bash
pip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client
```
